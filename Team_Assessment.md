# Team Assessment

I just want to start off and say that I feel bad for the other groups because they didn't have the best teammates you could wish for. Adam, Nora and Travor were amazing to work with and very suportive and encouraging.

## Communication Protocol
Our communication protocol was very basic. We primarily used slack, class time and office hours to communicate to help eachother with any issues encountered. Towards the end of the project, we used zoom frequently to get together and work on the project as a team and get consensus on various analyses and aesthetic choices. I think the only thing I would do differently is work on time management as a team come up with a clearer scope earlier on. That being said, I think we preformed extraordinarily as a team

## Strengths, Tips and Advice
Overwhelmingly, our strength as a team was having softskills and communication. Our team was very positive, supportive and understanding. We had no real conflicts and if there was any criticism, it was presented constructively and it was addressed democratically. I would recommend to other groups to make sure they are supportive, encouring and patient with their teammates. It really makes a huge difference.
