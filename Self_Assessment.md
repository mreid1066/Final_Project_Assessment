# Self Assessment
## Contribution Summary

We came to a consensus very early on regarding our roles in the group. My primary role was to develop the machine learning model. I was very interested in the machine learning portion because I knew it would be very hands on and also challenging. I was not expecting initially to be so hands-on with the preprocessing but quickly determined that knowing what features and values we want to train our model on, I was best suited for being responsible for the preprocessing.

I also felt that by being responsible for the machine learning portion, the other team members had to rely on my analysis for their portions including connecting the models and preprocessing to the database and also having the analysis complete so visualizations and slides could be created. This created almost a POC role, especially when discussing our project with TA's and the instructor.

## Challenges
There were several challenges that I faced over the course of this project. Notably I had Covid the weekend that the first deliverable was due and want to give all the gratitude and thanks to my group for stepping up. Time management and scope of the project were also challenging. However, the most difficult part of this project was actually building the model and getting it to fit our datasets. A lot of trial and error was required for this and it required patience from my team and also quickly learning explicitely how the linear regression and other models function and if our data would preform well in those models. Getting relatively large negative numbers for our r-squared values was deflating but we overcame this with persistance.
